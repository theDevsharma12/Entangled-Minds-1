                                    <h5>Therapy and counseling</h5>

                                    <p>Therapy and counseling are foundational pillars in mental health care. They provide individuals with a safe and confidential space to express their thoughts and feelings. Trained professionals, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, and counselors, offer guidance, coping strategies, and treatment options tailored to the individual's specific needs. Therapy and counseling can be instrumental in managing conditions like depression, anxiety, and PTSD. </p>

                                    <p>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), for example, is effective in addressing thought patterns and behaviors associated with various mental health issues. It is a collaborative process that empowers individuals to develop the skills necessary for emotional well-being.</p>

                                    <h5>Support Groups</h5>

                                    <p>
                                        Support groups offer a sense of community and understanding for individuals facing similar mental health challenges. These groups bring people together to share their experiences, challenges, and triumphs. Whether in-person or online, support groups provide a space where participants can feel less isolated and more validated in their struggles.</p>
                                    <p>This shared connection can reduce feelings of loneliness and stigmatization. Support groups often focus on specific conditions or life experiences, such as bereavement, addiction recovery, or the unique challenges faced by veterans. The mutual encouragement and shared insights in these groups can be a valuable part of an individual's mental health journey.</p>

                        <p>Aim to get 7-8 hours every night. When we don’t get enough rest, our minds and bodies can become over-stressed and exhausted, leading to poor mental health.</p>

                        <p>Working out releases hormones, such as endorphins, that can help improve your mood and overall well-being. Find an activity you enjoy, like running, dancing, or playing with your dog, and set aside time each week to do it.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h4><b>8. Say “No” when needed.</b></h4>
